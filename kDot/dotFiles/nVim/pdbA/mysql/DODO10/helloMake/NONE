Automatic Variables

Automatic variables are set by make after a rule is matched. There include:

    $@: the target filename.
    $*: the target filename without the file extension.
    $<: the first prerequisite filename.
    $^: the filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces, discard duplicates.
    $+: similar to $^, but includes duplicates.
    $?: the names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.

For example, we can rewrite the earlier makefile as:

all: h2EX
 
# $@ matches the target; $< matches the first dependent
h2EX: hello.o
	gcc -o $@ $<
    $@: the target filename.
    $<: the first prerequisite filename.

hello.o: hello.c
	gcc -c $<
    $<: the first prerequisite filename.
     
clean:
	rm hello.o h2EX
