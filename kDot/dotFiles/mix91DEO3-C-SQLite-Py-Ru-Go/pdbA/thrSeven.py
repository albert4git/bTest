It is not necessary to retain an explicit handle to all of the daemon threads in order to ensure
they have completed before exiting the main process. enumerate() returns a list of active Thread
instances. The list includes the current thread, and since joining the current thread is not allowed
(it introduces a deadlock situation), it must be skipped.
