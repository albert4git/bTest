"""

Sometimes it is useful to allow more than one worker access to
resource at a time, while still
limiting the overall number. For example, a connection pool might support
fixed number of
simultaneous connections, or a network application might support
fixed number of concurrent
downloads. A Semaphore is one way to manage those connections.
