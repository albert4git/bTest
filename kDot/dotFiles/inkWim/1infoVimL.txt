The second piece is the :nohlsearch command. This simply clears the search highlighting from the search we just performed so it's not distracting.

The final piece is a sequence of three normal mode commands:

    k: move up a line. Since we were on the first character of the line of equal signs, we're now on the first character of the heading text.
    v: enter (characterwise) visual mode.
    g_: move to the last non-blank character of the current line. We use this instead of $ because $ would highlight the newline character as well, and this isn't what we want.

Results

That was a lot of work, but now we've looked at each part of the mapping. To recap:

    We created a operator-pending mapping for "inside this section's heading".
    We used execute and normal! to run the normal commands we needed to select the heading, and allowing us to use special characters in those.
    Our mapping searches for the line of equal signs which denotes a heading and visually selects the heading text above that.
    Vim handles the rest.

Let's look at one more mapping before we move on. Run the following command:

:onoremap ah :<c-u>execute "normal! ?^==\\+$\r:nohlsearch\rg_vk0"<cr>

Try it by putting your cursor in a section's text and typing cah. This time Vim will delete not only the heading's text but also the line of equal signs that denotes a heading. You can think of this movement as "around this section's heading".

What's different about this mapping? Let's look at them side by side:

:onoremap ih :<c-u>execute "normal! ?^==\\+$\r:nohlsearch\rkvg_"<cr>
:onoremap ah :<c-u>execute "normal! ?^==\\+$\r:nohlsearch\rg_vk0"<cr>

The only difference from the previous mapping is the very end, where we select the text to operate on:

inside heading: kvg_
around heading: g_vk0

The rest of the mapping is the same, so we still start on the first character of the line of equal signs. From there:

    g_: move to the last non-blank character in the line.
    v: enter (characterwise) visual mode.
    k: move up a line. This puts us on the line containing the heading's text.
    0: move to the first character of the line.
